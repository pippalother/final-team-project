App utilizing CoreML framework with image recognition for water bottles

We plan create an app that can upload a photo from the user's camera roll (UI image picker controller) or take a live capture photo and categorize the subject as either a water bottle or not. We will have a welcome page with a choice to either proceed to live capture or to choose a photo from the camera roll. The next step will have a popup that displays a message that either confirms or denies that the subject is in fact a water bottle. There will also be an option to return to the original screen that displays the option to take or choose an existing photo.
